# PortfolioAPI

A clean, production-style **ASP.NET Core Web API** built as a portfolio project to demonstrate real-world backend design patterns, HTTP semantics, and API best practices.

This API manages products with filtering, pagination, soft deletion, analytics, and operational endpoints commonly found in professional systems.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Core CRUD

* Create, read, update, and soft-delete products
* In-memory data store (intentionally simple for clarity)

### Filtering & Querying

* Search by name
* Filter by category
* Filter by price range (`minPrice`, `maxPrice`)
* Sorting by name or price

### Pagination

* Offset-based pagination using `skip` and `take`
* Pagination metadata returned in:

  * Response body
  * HTTP headers (`X-Total-Count`, `X-Skip`, `X-Take`)

### HTTP Semantics

* `GET /api/product` – Full product listing
* `HEAD /api/product` – Headers-only pagination metadata
* Proper status codes (`200`, `201`, `204`, `400`, `404`)

### Soft Delete

* Products are marked as deleted instead of removed
* Deleted items are excluded from queries

### Analytics

* `GET /api/product/stats`
* Returns aggregate insights:

  * Total products
  * Active vs deleted
  * Min / max / average price

### Observability & Reliability

* Global exception handling middleware
* Request correlation ID (`X-Request-Id`) on every request/response
* Health check endpoint (`/health`)

### Developer Experience

* Swagger / OpenAPI documentation
* Enum-safe JSON serialization (case-insensitive)
* CORS configured for local frontend development

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Products

```
GET    /api/product
HEAD   /api/product
GET    /api/product/{id}
POST   /api/product
PUT    /api/product/{id}
DELETE /api/product/{id}
```

### Analytics

```
GET /api/product/stats
```

### Health

```
GET /health
```

---

## 🔎 Example Requests

### Create a product

```json
POST /api/product
{
  "name": "Laptop",
  "price": 1200,
  "category": "Electronics"
}
```

### Filter and paginate

```
GET /api/product?category=Electronics&minPrice=500&skip=0&take=10
```

### Lightweight pagination check

```
HEAD /api/product
```
